/**
 * E2E regression suite for the Anthropic 400 error family:
 *
 *   "messages.N.content.M: thinking or redacted_thinking blocks in the
 *    latest assistant message cannot be modified. These blocks must remain
 *    as they were in the original response."
 *
 * Three distinct bugs have been observed in production sessions
 * (ses_331acff95fferWZOYF1pG0cjOn is the canonical reproducer). Each bug
 * causes the plugin to mutate content that ultimately becomes part of an
 * assistant block carrying signed thinking. Anthropic re-validates those
 * signatures against the replayed content on every request and rejects the
 * call if anything differs.
 *
 * These tests drive a real `opencode serve` process against a mock Anthropic
 * server that returns thinking blocks with signatures, simulate the plugin-
 * level state that triggered each bug in production, and assert against the
 * exact bytes sent to the mock on the next request.
 *
 *   Bug A — Nudge anchor on a thinking-bearing assistant.
 *           Plugin's reinjectNudgeAtAnchor would append <instruction> text to
 *           the signed assistant's content on every defer pass.
 *           Fix: `hasThinkingBearingParts` guard in nudge-injection.ts.
 *
 *   Bug B — User message shell removal between assistants.
 *           stripDroppedPlaceholderMessages collapsed user turns whose text
 *           became `[dropped §N§]`, causing AI SDK's Anthropic adapter to
 *           merge adjacent assistants and mutate the "latest assistant"
 *           block structure.
 *           Fix: role check in stripDroppedPlaceholderMessages + truncation
 *           path in apply-operations.
 *
 *   Bug C — File/image part stripping when companion text is dropped.
 *           `file` was listed as METADATA in strip-content.ts, so an image-
 *           bearing user message could be stripped entirely when its text
 *           became `[dropped §N§]`, silently deleting the screenshot.
 *           Fix: remove `file` from METADATA_PART_TYPES.
 *
 * All three fixes are verified here end-to-end.
